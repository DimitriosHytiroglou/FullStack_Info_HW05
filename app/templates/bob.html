i would argue that there are two main parties that control bitcoin. The first is the miners, and the second in the investors, or holders of bitcoin. Further, one could make an argument about its developers as well. The miners control bitcoin for a few reasons. First of all, without them bitcoin cannot operate, no transactions can be made, so that's that. If all the miners where to decide to stop mining, bitcoin would be dead. Second of all, miners decide what is true or not on the blockchain, this however is an indirect form of control, as they have it only as a whole, but not individually. Excluding the quite improbable case of a 51%, no subset of the miners can exert individual arbitrary control over the bitcoin blockchain, so in a sense they all control it together by indirectly agreeing through the consensus mechanism.
